	<h2>About My Life (To Date)</h2>

		<p class="websiteBio">
			I was born in a town much like any other in America. I wish I could remember my early years better, but I did not move for the first ninteen years of my life, and much of what I remember about the places in my hometown have been diluted over the years with newer memories surpressing older ones. Suffice to say that experiences of my young days are on the losing side of too large a sample size.
