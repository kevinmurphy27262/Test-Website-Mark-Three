						Here I am on the Fourth of July, 2014 on top of a mountain called Klondie Peak in the Wind River Range of Wyoming. This particular peak is located on the continental divide so you have an enormous field of view to both the east and west. Taken during my NOLS expedition.

					<p>
						This is an eerie image of the Joker from one of my favorite comic book storylines, Batman: The Long Halloween. I feel like the art of animation in comic books is something that can often make or break the quality of the story itself.
